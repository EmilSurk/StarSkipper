# 2D Game Development with HTML Canvas

![Game Preview](https://youtu.be/y9iZqcwAiLo)

This project is a simple 2D game developed using HTML Canvas. It includes various features to create a dynamic gaming experience. Below are the different parts of the project and their descriptions:

## Part 1: Starry Sky & Environment

- Instead of manually creating the sky, it is procedurally generated for a more dynamic effect.
- The starry sky is created using data generated by the `generate_constellations()` function.
- Stars are represented as circles with a radius of 3px.
- Constellations are represented with dashed lines connecting the stars.

## Part 2: Parallax Effect

- To simulate depth, a parallax effect is used.
- The environment includes rectangular buildings placed at three different depths.
- Buildings closer to the viewer move faster, creating a parallax effect.
- Buildings are randomly generated with varying heights and colors.

## Part 3: Spaceship Modeling

- A spaceship is modeled and drawn in the center of the canvas.
- Various shapes are used to create the spaceship.
- A plasma propulsion effect is achieved using `shadowBlur` and `shadowColor` properties of HTML Canvas.

## Part 4: Keyboard Interaction

- Basic keyboard interactions are added to the game.
- The following features are implemented:
  - Left arrow key (A): Moves the spaceship to the left.
  - Right arrow key (D): Moves the spaceship to the right.
  - Up arrow key (W): Moves the spaceship upward.
  - Down arrow key (S): Moves the spaceship downward.
  - Space key: Increases the spaceship's speed and extends the propulsion plume.
